2. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2.1 This License governs the use, modification, and distribution of all
    software products, source code, object code, and related materials that
    are authored, maintained, or published by Rovel Stars and distributed
    under this RSSL, except where a Product Addendum or a Third-Party
    License provides additional or overriding terms.

2.2 Components of the Software that are governed by Third-Party Licenses
    (including permissive, copyleft, or proprietary licenses) are excluded
    from the scope of this RSSL to the extent of any inconsistency and are
    governed solely by their respective license terms.

2.3 This License applies only to Software that is the original creation of
    Rovel Stars or that incorporates Contributions accepted under a valid
    Contributor License Agreement (CLA) or comparable agreement executed by
    the contributor. Use of this License text by third parties for unrelated
    projects does not create any affiliation, endorsement, or liability on
    the part of Rovel Stars. All Contributions accepted are licensed under
    this RSSL and any applicable Product Addendum.

2.4 In the event of a conflict between the terms of this RSSL and any
    applicable Product Addendum or Third-Party License, the Product Addendum
    or the Third-Party License (as applicable) shall govern to the extent
    of the inconsistency for the subject matter in question.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. GRANT OF RIGHTS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3.1 Subject to the terms of this RSSL and any applicable Product Addendum,
    Rovel Stars hereby grants Users a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
    revocable license to:
    (a) use the Software in Source Code or Object Code form;
    (b) reproduce, build, and run the Software for personal, educational,
        research, or internal business purposes; and
    (c) create, distribute, and exercise rights in Derivative Works under the
        conditions set forth in Section 3.2 and Section 4.

3.2 Redistribution Conditions. Any redistribution, whether in Source Code
    or Object Code form, of Software that incorporates Rovel Stars-authored
    components must:
    (a) include a full copy of this RSSL and any applicable Product Addendum(s);
    (b) identify and document all modifications made to the original Software;
    (c) include prominent attribution to Rovel Stars and a URL to the
        official Rovel Stars repository or project page; and
    (d) preserve notices, attributions, and copyright statements included
        in the original Software.

3.3 Restrictions. Unless expressly authorized by a written agreement with
    Rovel Stars or by an applicable Product Addendum:
    (a) Redistribution or distribution of Derivative Works for Commercial Use,
        Partner programs, or Enterprise redistribution is prohibited;
    (b) Users may not remove, alter, or obscure Rovel Stars trademarks,
        logos, or notices; and
    (c) Users shall not use the Software to produce works that misrepresent
        Rovel Stars’ authorship or endorsement.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. FORKS, DERIVATIVE WORKS, AND COPYLEFT CONTINUITY
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4.1 Attribution and Source Disclosure. Any Fork, Derivative Work, or other
    redistribution that includes Rovel Stars-authored components must:
    (a) clearly identify itself as a modification or derivative of Rovel Stars
        Software and include a URL or reference to the official Rovel Stars
        repository or product page;
    (b) make available the complete corresponding Source Code for any
        distributed Object Code under the same RSSL and any applicable
        Product Addendum(s);
    (c) include a complete copy of this RSSL and any applicable Product
        Addendum(s) in the redistributed package; and
    (d) clearly document all substantive changes made.

4.2 License Continuity. All Forks and Derivative Works of Rovel Stars-authored
    components must remain licensed under RSSL. This requirement propagates
    to subsequent Forks and Derivative Works (i.e., the reciprocal/viral
    effect for Rovel Stars-authored components).

4.3 Commercial Restriction for Derivatives. Derivative Works and Forks may
    not be used for Commercial Use, Partner programs, or Enterprise
    redistribution without an express, written license from Rovel Stars.

4.4 Trademark and Branding. Forks and Derivative Works must not use or
    display Rovel Stars trademarks, service marks, product names, or logos
    in a manner that implies endorsement or official status without express
    written permission from Rovel Stars.

4.5 Fork Liability. Rovel Stars disclaims responsibility or liability for any
    Forks, Derivative Works, or redistributions created by third parties.
    Responsibility for compliance, security, and legal obligations for those
    Forks rests solely with their authors and distributors.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5. CONTRIBUTIONS AND CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT (CLA)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

5.1 By submitting a Contribution, the Contributor represents and warrants that:
    (a) they are the sole author of the Contribution or have obtained all rights,
    consents, and permissions necessary to grant the rights and licenses set
    forth in this Section 5;
    (b) the Contribution is original to the Contributor or is otherwise lawfully
    licensed for submission; and
    (c) the Contribution does not violate any law, does not infringe any
    third-party intellectual property or moral rights, and does not contain
    malware, backdoors, or other intentionally harmful code.

5.2 Subject to the terms of this RSSL, each Contributor hereby grants Rovel Stars
    and its affiliates, successors, licensees, and assigns a perpetual,
    irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable,
    sublicensable license to:
    (a) use, reproduce, copy, modify, prepare derivative works of, publicly
    display, publicly perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit the Contribution;
    and
    (b) incorporate the Contribution in whole or in part into the Software
    and to license or relicense the resulting work under RSSL, any successor
    license, or any other license chosen by Rovel Stars (including proprietary or
    dual-licensing arrangements).

5.3 Each Contributor hereby grants to Rovel Stars and to recipients of the
    Software a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license under
    any patent claims that are necessarily infringed by the Contributor's
    Contribution to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
    otherwise distribute and exploit the Contribution alone or as part of
    the Software. If a Contributor (or any entity controlled by, controlling,
    or under common control with the Contributor) initiates, assists,
    or participates in any patent litigation asserting that the Software or any
    Contribution infringes a patent owned or licensed by the Contributor, then the
    patent license granted in this Section 5.3 (to the extent it applies to the patent
    claims asserted) shall terminate automatically and without notice.

5.4 To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Contributor irrevocably waives
    (or agrees not to assert) any moral rights or similar rights in the
    Contribution that would interfere with the rights granted in this Section 5. The
    Contributor consents to reasonable attribution of authorship and copyright notices
    by Rovel Stars in source code, documentation, or other materials where such attribution
    customarily appears.

5.5 Third-Party Materials and Compatible Licensing. If a Contribution contains or is
    derived from third‑party code, the Contributor must disclose the origin, provide
    copies of any applicable third-party licenses, and confirm that those materials may
    be redistributed under terms compatible with this RSSL or with any additional Product
    Addendum identified by Rovel Stars. Rovel Stars may refuse, remove, or require
    remediation of Contributions that contain incompatible third‑party materials.

5.6 Rovel Stars may, at its discretion, require execution of a written Contributor
    License Agreement (CLA), Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), assignment,
    or other agreement as a    condition to accepting or merging a Contribution.
    Acceptance of a Contribution by Rovel Stars is effective only when the
    Contribution is explicitly accepted, merged, or otherwise included in an
    official Rovel Stars codebase in accordance with the project's contribution
    policy and any required agreement has been executed.

5.7 The Contributor agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Rovel Stars,
    its officers, directors, employees, agents, licensees, and other contributors
    from and against all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses
    (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with
    any breach of the representations, warranties, or obligations in this Section
    5, including third-party claims of infringement or breach of contract
    resulting from the Contribution. This indemnity obligation survives any 
    termination of the Contributor's rights under this RSSL.

5.8 The representations, warranties, licenses, indemnities, and other
    obligations in this Section 5 survive any acceptance, rejection, or removal of
    a Contribution and survive termination of this RSSL to the extent necessary to
    give effect to their intent.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6. THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS AND LICENSE COMPATIBILITY
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    Party Licenses"). Such components remain governed by their respective
    licenses.

6.2 Users redistributing the Software must comply with any source-distribution,
    attribution, or other obligations required by included Third-Party Licenses.
    Rovel Stars will provide notices and instructions for obtaining corresponding
    source where legally required through product documentation or the official
    Rovel Stars website.

6.3 Nothing in this RSSL is intended to limit, alter, or supersede rights or
    obligations that arise under applicable Third-Party Licenses with respect
    to those third-party components.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7. SECURITY, INTEGRITY, AND UPDATES (BASELINE)

7.2 Users and contributors must not intentionally bypass, modify, or
    misrepresent any technical or cryptographic protection included in the
    Software.

7.3 Product-specific update, signing, distribution, and key-management
    requirements are defined in the applicable Product Addendum and not in
    this baseline RSSL.

7.4 Rovel Stars reserves the right to revoke, suspend, or re-issue cryptographic
    keys and to recall or disable updates if key compromise, policy violation,
    or security risk is detected.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8.1 The Software will not collect Personal Data without explicit, informed
    consent from the User, except for minimal data necessary to provide
    security-related functionality where lawful.

    required by law, clearly disclosed, and controllable by the User.

8.3 Partners, redistributors, and contributors must not collect, transmit,
    monetize, or otherwise process Personal Data obtained through the Software
    without a lawful basis and without complying with applicable privacy laws.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
9. FEES, PRICING, AND UPGRADE POLICY
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
9.1 Rovel Stars may introduce, modify, or discontinue fees, subscriptions,
    or paid editions for any product or service at its discretion.

9.2 Material changes to fees or licensing terms will be published with
    reasonable notice. Continued use of updated products after publication
    constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

9.3 Fees paid for commercial programs, certifications, or enterprise licenses
    are non-refundable unless Rovel Stars elects otherwise in writing.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
10. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
10.1 THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITHOUT WARRANTY

10.2 TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ROVEL STARS, ITS
     AFFILIATES, CONTRIBUTORS, AND LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
     DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOSS OF
     DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, WHETHER
     IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE,
     ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE, EVEN
     IF ROVEL STARS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

10.3 USERS ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR BACKING UP AND PROTECTING THEIR OWN DATA.
     ROVEL STARS DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR DATA LOSS OR DAMAGE ARISING FROM
     THE USE OR MISUSE OF THE SOFTWARE.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
11. TERMINATION
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
11.1 This License terminates automatically and without notice if you breach
     any material term of this License, including failure to comply with the
     copyleft obligations in Section 4, or if you initiate patent litigation
     against Rovel Stars or its contributors concerning the Software.

11.2 Upon termination, you must immediately: (a) cease distribution of the
     Software and any Derivative Works; (b) remove or disable access to binaries
     or downloads you control that contain Rovel Stars components; and (c)
     remove Rovel Stars trademarks and branding from derivative distributions.

11.3 Provisions that by their nature survive termination (including Sections 4,
     6, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15) shall remain in effect.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
12. PRODUCT ADDENDUMS

     (for example, in the product repository, distribution package, or
     official documentation) and is identified by product name and version.

12.3 In the event of a conflict between this RSSL and a Product Addendum,
     the Product Addendum controls with respect to the subject matter of that
     Product Addendum; this RSSL continues to govern all other matters.

12.4 Propagation. Any Product Addendum applicable to a product shall also
     apply to any Fork or Derivative Work of that product. Persons creating
     or distributing Forks of such products must include and comply with the
     official Product Addendum(s).

12.5 Authority. Only Rovel Stars holds the exclusive right to create, publish,
     amend, or withdraw Product Addendum(s). No third party, Fork author, or

     existing Product Addendum. Any such attempted modification is void and
     without effect.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

     in product repositories, or within product distributions constitutes
     sufficient notice to Users and contributors.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
15.1 The parties shall first attempt to resolve any dispute arising out of or
     relating to this License through good-faith electronic communication for

     notice of the dispute.

15.2 If the dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of the notice
     under Section 15.1, the dispute shall be submitted to non-binding
     arbitration conducted via a recognized virtual Alternative Dispute
     Resolution (ADR) platform agreed upon by the parties. The parties
     shall make a good-faith effort to select the ADR platform; if no
     agreement is reached within seven (7) days, Rovel Stars may select
     the platform.

15.3 If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days of the notice
     under Section 15.1, the dispute shall be submitted to confidential,
     binding arbitration seated in New Delhi, India, under the Arbitration
     and Conciliation Act, 1996. The arbitration shall be conducted in English
     and administered according to the arbitration rules selected by Rovel
     Stars from a recognized arbitration institution (e.g., SIAC, ICC, LCIA).
     The arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to grant all remedies
     available under applicable law, including injunctive relief.

15.4 Nothing in this Section shall prevent Rovel Stars from seeking injunctive,
     provisional, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction
     to protect its intellectual property rights or confidentiality obligations,
     either before, during, or after the arbitration process.

15.5 All proceedings, documents, evidence, and outcomes related to Sections
     15.2 and 15.3 shall be strictly confidential, except as necessary to
     enforce any arbitration award or seek remedies under Section 15.4.
